<#
Sample data - $PSScriptRoot\JsonResultsmall.json


This data will be used in a powershell function that will return the service name for a given port number or the port number for a given service name.
The function will be called Get-PortService
It should retrieve the json data from $PSScriptRoot\allTCPports.json
Using the json data, create a class that can be used to filter the data based on port number or service name
The class should have the following properties:
ServiceName, PortNumber, Description, Reference
The parameters should be of the correct type and accept multiple values
The class should have constructors
The constructors should accept a the list of properties from the json data
The class should have methods
The class should have a method that returns the properties for a given port number and should accept a port number as a parameter or a wildcard
The class should have a method that returns the properties for a given service name and should accept a service name as a parameter or a wildcard
Using the class, create a function that will return an array of objects
The function should accept a port number or service name
The function should accept wildcards
The function should return an array of objects that match the port number or service name
The function should return an empty array if no matches are found
Create the powershell class, with any constructors and methods required and also create the powershell function and examples
