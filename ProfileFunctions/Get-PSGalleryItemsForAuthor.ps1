.DESCRIPTION 
This script will save all versions of all scripts and modules published to the PowerShell Gallery by a given Author.
The Author is specified in the manifest for each item, and is expected to be consistent for a given user.

The script assumes that there is at least 1 version of every item that is listed. 
This can be verified by logging into the PowerShell Gallery, navigating to https://www.powershellgallery.com/account/Packages.
If there are items that are hidden, they will be shown at the bottom of that page under the header: "Unlisted Items"

Use instructions: 
* Provide the AuthorName, which is the Author used in the item manifest. 
  Note that the Author is not guaranteed to match the Owner, which is the account name for those who publish the item.
* Provide the LocalFolder to place all the PowerShell Gallery items into. 

For questions on this script, email cgadmin@microsoft.com 

.Example 
GetPSGalleryItemsForAuthor -AuthorName 'J. Keith Bankston' -LocalFolder c:\temp\test

This will find all items where 'J. Keith Bankston' is listed as an author, and save them into c:\temp\test. 
The folder will be created if it does not exist.
