DESCRIPTION
    The Get-MailContact cmdlet retrieves all attributes of the specified contact. No parameters are required. If the cmdlet is run without a parameter, a complete list of contacts for the Exchange organization is returned.
    
    You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet (https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
    

PARAMETERS
    -ANR <String>
        The Anr parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are:
        
        - CommonName (CN)
        
        - DisplayName
        
        - FirstName
        
        - LastName
        
        - Alias
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Filter <String>
        The Filter parameter uses OPath syntax to filter the results by the specified properties and values. The search criteria uses the syntax `"Property -ComparisonOperator 'Value'"`.
        
        - Enclose the whole OPath filter in double quotation marks " ". If the filter contains system values (for example, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`), use single quotation marks ' ' instead. Although this parameter is a string (not a system block), you can also use braces { }, but only if the filter doesn't contain variables.
        
        - Property is a filterable property. For more information about the filterable properties, see Filterable properties for the Filter parameter (https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/filter-properties). - ComparisonOperator is an OPath comparison operator (for example `-eq` for equals and `-like` for string comparison). For more information about comparison operators, see about_Comparison_Operators (https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators). - Value is the property value to search for. Enclose text values and variables in single quotation marks (`'Value'` or `'$Variable'`). If a variable value contains single quotation marks, you need to identify (escape) the single quotation marks to expand the variable correctly. For example, instead of `'$User'`, use `'$($User -Replace "'","''")'`. Don't enclose integers or system values (for example, `500`, `$true`, `$false`, or `$null`).
        
        You can chain multiple search criteria together using the logical operators `-and` and `-or`. For example, `"Criteria1 -and Criteria2"` or `"(Criteria1 -and Criteria2) -or Criteria3"`.
        
        For detailed information about OPath filters in Exchange, see Additional OPATH syntax information (https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipient-filters#additional-opath-syntax-information).
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Identity <MailContactIdParameter>
        The Identity parameter specifies the mail contact that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mail contact. For example:
        
        - Name
        
        - Alias
        
        - Distinguished name (DN)
        
        - Canonical DN
        
        - Email address
        
        - GUID
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    1
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       True
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -OrganizationalUnit <OrganizationalUnitIdParameter>
        The OrganizationalUnit parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's returned by the Get-OrganizationalUnit cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example:
        
        - Name
        
        - Canonical name
        
        - Distinguished name (DN)
        
        - GUID
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -RecipientTypeDetails <RecipientTypeDetails[]>
        The RecipientTypeDetails parameter filters the results by the specified mail contact subtype. Valid values are:
        
        - MailContact
        
        - MailForestContact
        
        
        You can specify multiple values separated by commas.
        
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -ResultSize <Unlimited>
        The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                None
        Accept pipeline input?       False
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -SortBy <String>
        The SortBy parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order.
        
        If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with ` | Format-Table -Auto Property1,Property2,...PropertyX`. to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (*) in the property names are supported.
        
        You can sort by the following properties:
        
        - Name
        
        - DisplayName
        
        - Alias

    -Credential <PSCredential>
        The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions.
        
        A value for this parameter requires the Get-Credential cmdlet. To pause this command and receive a prompt for credentials, use the value `(Get-Credential)`. Or, before you run this command, store the credentials in a variable (for example, `$cred = Get-Credential`) and then use the variable name (`$cred`) for this parameter. For more information, see Get-Credential (https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential).
